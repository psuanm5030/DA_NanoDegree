    "### Overview\n",
    "#### I selected my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA to complete this project.  Using the MongoDB Data Wrangling lecture problems and problem sets as my foundation, I believe I have sufficiently audited, parsed and explored this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### The following is a list of the steps I took to complete this project:\n",
    "1. Downloaded the OSM XML data for Pittsburgh (via Mapzen).  The file was 372.9 MB (5,214,306 lines).\n",
    "2. Iteratively audited the data using Python (Proj_1.1_Audit_XML.py).\n",
    "3. Iteratively parsed and cleansed the data into a JSON file (Proj_1.2_Parse_to_JSON.py).  The JSON file was 528.1 MB.\n",
    "4. Imported the JSON file into a MongoDB database and collection.  1,820,148 documents were imported.\n",
    "5. Analyzed the new collection using pymongo in python by creating pipelines that queried the collection (Proj_1.3_Review.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Below, I present several major areas of discussion as I progressed through this project."

    "It should be noted that I re-wrote all the class scripts locally, adding my own efficiencies and documentation, to audit, parse and review the OSM Pittsburgh data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problems Encountered in the Map\n",
    "Overall, it should be noted that I encountered relatively minor issues when reviewing the data in python. They are listed below:  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Postal Codes \n",
    "* Pittsburgh zip codes most commonly begin with 15, however I noticed there were 13 zip codes that did not start with 15. Upon further review, I noticed that the dataset contained more than simply Pittsburgh Metro [Link for MapZen](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts) - it contained more more expansive data.  I chased down each of the 13 postal codes and noted they were appropriate (most were in neighboring Ohio and West Virginia).  \n",
    "* During the audit process, I noticed some erroneous looking postal codes: \"425 1/2\", \"California PA, 15419\", \"PA 15033, and \"PA 15601\".  With the exception of \"425 1/2\", I noticed these items actually had a legitimate zip code.  Therefore, when parsing (script Proj_1.2_Parse_to_JSON.py), I wrote a function \"cleanPostal\" which returned the first 5 digits together.  This enabled \"California PA, 15419\" to be input as \"15419\", discarding \"California PA,\".  Additionally, this took care of instances where the 9 digit postal code was noted (something I was not interested in keeping).  If the regular expression could not be matched, \"00000\" was returned (signaling to me the erroneous items, but still fitting the format).  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Street Mapping\n",
    "* As discussed during the class, I made several additions the the mapping dictionary to ensure that items such as \"Sq\" were replaced with \"Square\".  I made 13 such mappings, 3 of which were related to variations of avenue.  Further, I made many additions to the expected list to ensure that items such as Circle, Cove, and Pike were deemed acceptable (among others).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Problem Characters\n",
    "* Luckily, there was only one tag type with a problem character present - a space, which actually coincided with a typo in the amenity tag name --> {'k': 'business tyoe', 'v': 'Insurance Agency'} - this item was excluded during the parsing phase (see function checkSkipItems).  This led me to some conclusions regarding the depth of data - particularly that there are alot of tags types (1,038 to be exact). Of those I noted:\n",
    "    - Highway, Name and several tiger fields were most popular.\n",
    "    - 853 of the 1,038 tag types were used less than 100 times. 379 of these 853 were only used once!  \n",
    "    - Upon further review, many of these belong to relation elements and therefore are correctly ignored during my parsing process.\n",

    "### 2. Understanding the Data\n",
    "I spent nearly 6 hours working through the parsing scripts (from class) again, ensuring that I understood everything that was happening, however I believe I may have spent a similar amount of time exploring the data in MongoDB - through pipelines created in python (via pymongo package) and in the mongo shell.

    "\n",
    "* #### Conclusion 1: I found that restaurants were number 1, with 147 unique users creating these tags.  This was of little surprise, as restuarants are constently opening / shutting down.  Maybe there are some owners that thought it was important to get their establishment listed within OSM data (obviously the more places your establishment is defined, the more traffic you can drive to your business).  Further, I imagine it is difficult for one user to cover them all, with the thought that regular contributors are not checking / editing to ensure restaurants are accurately reflected / updated.  I think a strategy to improve the data would be to review the amenities that are not well covered by the community - then spread the word so that contributors focus efforts on the lesser amenities - as shown below - trailer parks, gambling, ev_charging, etc.  These are not great examples, but I imagine there are more than 1 ev charging stations (despite this being Pennsylvania and not California).\n",
