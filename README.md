# Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree

In July 2015, I decided to participate and dedicate myself to completing Udacity’s Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  The program was estimated to take ~18 months, so my decision was well thought through.  I wanted something that was going to be challenging, but also I wanted some sort of credential.  And I wanted something that was more robust than a single class or a single discipline.  I also considered a Master’s degree, but to be honest, a Master’s was infinitely more expensive and it didn’t fit my need for the course to conform to my life.  I also believe that formal degrees can be overrated, particularly around a topic like data science, where I believe that most of the learning is done proactively by the learner, outside of a classroom.

I completed the degree program, and its 7 classes, roughly 10 months later.  In retrospect, it was tough.  Not only did you complete lectures, quizzes and exercises, but there was a project for each course.  All of this took time, and I sacrificed a lot of weekends and early mornings to get this done timely.  In the end it was worth every penny and hour.  I learned things that I could apply to my own little pet projects, as well as, my everyday work.
